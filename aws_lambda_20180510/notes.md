# Introduction to Lambda

**Serverless computing:**

Taken from article by [Mike Roberts](https://twitter.com/mikebroberts) on [martinfowler.com/articles/serverless.html](https://martinfowler.com/articles/serverless.html)

>	> Serverless architectures refer to applications that significantly depend on third-party services (knows as Backend as a Service or "BaaS") or on custom code that's run in ephemeral containers (Function as a Service or "FaaS"), the best known vendor host of which currently is AWS Lambda. By using these ideas, and by moving much behavior to the front end, such architectures remove the need for the traditional 'always on' server system sitting behind an application. Depending on the circumstances, such systems can significantly reduce operational cost and complexity at a cost of vendor dependencies and (at the moment) immaturity of supporting services.
